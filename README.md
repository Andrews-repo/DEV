# AWS-Project
Hello there!

You're probably wondeing why I've linked you here, and I will gladly answer that for you:

I needed a place to showcase skills I actually have from working with Amazon Web Services. 

I spent a long time studying and working to acheive the 3 Associate Certificates from Amazon; using both acloudguru.com as well as linuxacademy.com. 

These websites offered a lot of labs and projecs to do to get my hands dirty, and by all means feel comfortable with AWS. 

That being said I wanted to find a project to ~~struggle~~ work through, to push myself to learn, as well as solidify my AWS skills. 

Well, I found one, that was aimed for exactly the kind of work I want to do; [So you want to be an cloud engineer?](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8inzn5/so_you_want_to_learn_aws_aka_how_do_i_learn_to_be/).

Ive listed it to provide some clarity as to what will be listed [here](https://github.com/Andrews-repo/AWS-Project/blob/master/gitignore.md). It's actually the steps from the post, linking to my code or the files containing the code.

The goal here is to simplify the process for any potential empolyers to view what ive done, regardless of technical level.

This project is a work in progress (as of March 25 2020), has gone under many revisions, and will be expanded upon to include more services over time.
