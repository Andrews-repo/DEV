External Data

* Create a DynamoDB table and experiment with loading and retrieving data manually, then do the same via a script on your local machine.

* Refactor your static page into your Fortune-of-the-Day website (Node, PHP, Python, whatever) which reads/updates a list of fortunes in the AWS DynamoDB table. (Hint: EC2 Instance Role)

* Checkpoint: Your HA/AutoScaled website can now load/save data to a database between users and sessions
